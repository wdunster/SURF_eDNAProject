# SURF_eDNAProject
A data analysis project using environmental DNA to access fish distribution in Naragasnett Bay

As a RI C-AIM Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF), I am working under Dr. Carlos Prada and PhD student Taylor Lindsay at the University of Rhode Island. SURF aims to provide undergrads with hands on research experience to help inform their future career paths.
